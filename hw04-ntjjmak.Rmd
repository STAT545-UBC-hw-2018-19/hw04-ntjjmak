## There are two tasks for this assignment.

# 1. Data reshaping.
# 2. Perform a join.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


To start, let's load the packages to be used for data exploration.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
```

## Exercise #1: Reshaping data

The data to be used for the exercise is "gapminder".

Here is the data set in its original form:

```{r}
gapminder
```


To practise reshaping the data,


```{r}
summary(ChickWeight)
```
